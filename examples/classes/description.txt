Source file containing the entry point of the application.

### "$(OWLROOT)\include\owl\all.rc"

If you use dynamic linking, you should remove this file, since the OWLNext DLL contains
all the OWLNext resources already.

### "pch.h" and "pch.cpp"

Files for precompiled header use and creation. To use precompilation, include "pch.h" at
the start of your source files followed by "#pragma hdrstop" (see "main.cpp").
